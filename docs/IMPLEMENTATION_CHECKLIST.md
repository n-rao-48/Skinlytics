## 📋 How to Use the New Features

### In Code
```python
from ml.routine_builder import (
    generate_personalized_routine,
    generate_routine_insights
)

# Generate routine
routine = generate_personalized_routine(
    user_profile={...},
    ml_prediction={...},
    routine_type="Morning",
    routine_focus="Acne Control"
)

# Generate insights
insights = generate_routine_insights(
    user_profile={...},
    ml_prediction={...},
    routine={...}
)
```

### In UI
1. Go to Tab 3: Routine Builder
2. Select Morning/Night routine
3. Select focus area
4. Click "Generate Personalized Routine"
5. View routine + 6 insight sections
